Verifying the performance of a over fitting by using choosen database with python code
Evaluate the models using crossvalidation


from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load the breast cancer dataset
data = load_breast_cancer()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Defining the classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)

# Evaluating the model using cross-validation
cv_scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv=5)

# Outputting the cross-validation scores
print("Cross-validation Scores:", cv_scores)
print("Mean Cross-validation Score:", cv_scores.mean())
